# freeGPT
A free version of Generative AI powered package which augments search based on documents and video files without any need for internet connection or any API key.

1. Chat_youtube.ipynb: This python notebook helps one search for answers from a youtube recording which has a transcript available. It also exports out the transcript as a docx file.

2. docGPT.ipynb: This python notebook helps one search for answers from files of multiple types (word, doc,  html, csv, ppt). It can be a great aid if you want to quickly get objective and fact backed answers from a file using a web User Interface.

# Reading Resources and links
To understand LLM's, we must read books, related papers and practise codes to get a grip on them.<br>
Various books have been uploaded in the <a href="https://github.com/amaze18/freeGPT/tree/main/reading%20resources"> reading resources</a> folder.
